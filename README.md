<h1>(Discontinued) Jarparur</h1>
<p>Jarparur was a project based on a universe that i created a year ago, the universe of Jarparur was made for a D&D session, but it took a lot time and we never played tht campaign, so i decided to make it real, or something like that.</p>
<p>In this version, i took some inspirations from brilliant games: Dwarf Fortress, D&D Systems and Zelda. Those were the real drives that made me start that off.</p>
<p>Nowadays i'm not working on Jarparur CLI anymore, i recently started 2 versions of that universe in Unity, a 2D version (Top down, Zelda and Pok√©mon like) and a 3D version (Third person, Skyrim like) those gonna be the real Jarparur versions, both are called World of Jarparur, i don't know actually which version gonna be the real World of Jarparur, but i'm more into the 3D one.</p>
<p>So, Jarparur CLI is not gonna be continued anymore, maybe someday i'll comeback, but not now, so the project isn't gonna receive any update, don't wait for that for a while, i'll create a repo for the Unity version soon, that's gonna be the new Jarparur core game. I'm happy i reached this complexity of this project. See you soon.</p>
