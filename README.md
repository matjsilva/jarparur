Well, i finally came back.

A year ago i created a folder called Jarparur, inside this folder i created a file named main.py, and since this day i promised myself that i would bring this game alive to the world. Well... it didn't happened as i expected.

This is the first time i open this project since half a year or more, i realized how i was so novice to this language when i was writing this game script, but first things first, let me explain **what is** Jarparur. Jarparur is a fantasy world i've created 2 years ago, or more, i don't remember, it was written in a sheet of paper in a hurry so it wasn't really detailed, sometime after this i had the idea to make a game aabout this world, sadly i wasn't that good at Unity or Unreal and even at pixel art i've failed so i had the brilliant idea to make it a command line game, just like the old times, yet i wasn't so experienced in Python and i've failed again. This year i started to write a deep version of Jarparur's lore, aiming philosophical questions about this world and filling it with beautiful stories, this was my motivation to continue Jarparur's CLI game.

4 days ago i've loaded the repository in my laptop for the first time in months and then, i've (re)started the development of the game as a serious project, so expect some huge content here (it surpasses 2.5k lines of code at the time i'm writing this). I'm launching the Alpha 1.1.0 now. That's it. :)
