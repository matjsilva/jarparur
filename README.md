  I am a big fan of the RPG genre, it can be the electronic or the tabletop one, that's one of my passions and because of that, i finally created my own RPG universe, i've been writing this universe lore since 2 years ago. Jarparur became a game from the moment that i realised how big it can be, so it started here, at Windows CMD.
